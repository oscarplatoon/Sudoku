1.Enumerate all empty cells in typewriter order (left to right, top to bottom)

2.Our “current cell” is the first cell in the enumeration.

3.Enter a 1 into the current cell. If this violates the Sudoku condition, try entering a 2, then a 3, and so forth, until
a. the entry does not violate the Sudoku condition, or until
b. you have reached 9 and still violate the Sudoku condition.

4.In case a: if the current cell was the last enumerated one, then the puzzle is solved. If not, then go back to step 2 with the “current cell” being the next cell.
In case b: if the current cell is the first cell in the enumeration, then the Sudoku puzzle does not have a solution. If not, then erase the 9 from the corrent cell, call the previous cell in the enumeration the new “current cell”, and continue with step 3.

1. create a list of indices of empty cells, you also want to store numbers attempted with the indices
2. starting with the first cell in the list of empty cells, try 1, if zero is valid for that row/column/square, update that number in board, store the tried numbers with the indcies and move to the next empty cell in the list of empty cells. if 1 is invalid, try 2 and repeat until you try through 9. If 9 is not valid, clear tried cells for that indice go back to the last empty cell. Start with the next number not tried in the last empty cell.
3. do the above until the you pass the end of the list of empty indices
