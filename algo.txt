1. create a list of indices of empty cells, you also want to store numbers attempted with the indices

2. starting with the first cell in the list of empty cells,
 
 current_empty_cell_index = 1
 while True
    current_attempt = last_attempt from empty cells+1 (no attempts, current_attempt = 1)
    while current_attempt <= 9, 
      if current_attempt is valid for that row/column/square, update board with current_attempt, current_empty_cell_index += 1, if no empty cells remain, you've reached a solution, return with success message
      else if num is invalid, store current_attempt in empty_cells list of attempts for the current indice, increment current_attempt
    if 9 is not not valid (you've exhausted all empty cells)
      if you are checking the first empty cell there is no solution, so break with a message
      clear list of attempts for that empty cell indice, set board[empty_cell_indice] to 0, set board of last_attempt to 0
      move back to last empty cell
